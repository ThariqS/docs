AutoSteering allows you to automatically generate feature interventions based on natural language descriptions of desired behaviors. This provides an easy way to steer model outputs without manually selecting features.

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to use AutoSteer is with the `AutoEdit` method:

```python
# Create automatic feature edits for desired behavior
edits = client.features.AutoEdit(
    specification="be funny",  # Natural language description
    model=variant,  # Model variant to use
)

# Apply the edits to your variant
variant.set(edits)

# The model will now attempt to be funnier
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a story"}],
    model=variant
)
```

## How It Works

Under the hood, AutoSteer:

1. Generates contrastive examples of content with and without the desired behavior
2. Identifies the most relevant features that distinguish the behavior
3. Determines optimal feature values to encourage the desired behavior
4. Creates a set of feature edits that can be applied to the model

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Number of Features

You can control how many features are used in the generated edits:

```python
edits = client.features.AutoEdit(
    specification="be concise",
    model=variant,
    num_features_to_use=4  # Use fewer features for more focused steering
)
```

### Combining with Manual Edits

AutoSteer edits can be combined with manual feature interventions:

```python
# Generate automatic edits
auto_edits = client.features.AutoEdit(
    specification="be professional",
    model=variant
)

# Combine with manual feature edits
variant.set({
    **auto_edits,
    manual_feature: 0.8
})
```

### Using with Conditionals

AutoSteer can be used within conditional statements:

```python
# Generate edits for desired behavior
funny_edits = client.features.AutoEdit(
    specification="be funny",
    model=variant
)

# Apply edits conditionally
variant.set_when(context_feature > 0.5, funny_edits)
```

## Best Practices

- Use clear, specific behavior descriptions
- Test generated edits to ensure desired results
- Consider combining multiple AutoSteer edits for complex behaviors
- Adjust number of features based on steering precision needed
- Use with conditionals for context-aware behavior

## API Reference

### AutoEdit

Generate automatic feature edits based on natural language description.

**Parameters:**

<ResponseField name="specification" type="str" required>
  Natural language description of desired behavior
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="model" type="Union[str, Variant]" required>
  Model or variant to use for generating edits
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="num_features_to_use" type="int" default="8">
  Number of features to include in edits
</ResponseField>

**Returns:**

<ResponseField name="edits" type="dict[Feature, float]">
  Dictionary mapping features to their target values
</ResponseField>

**Example:**

```python
edits = client.features.AutoEdit(
    specification="be more creative",
    model=variant,
    num_features_to_use=6
)
```
