description: "Documentation for working with conditional feature interventions"
---

Conditionals allow you to define dynamic feature interventions that are applied based on the activation patterns of other features during model inference. This enables creating more sophisticated steering behaviors that respond to the content being generated.

Before using the Conditionals API, you'll need to find the [features](/sdk-reference/features) you want to intervene on, and a [model variant](/sdk-reference/variants)

## Examples

### Basic Conditional Intervention

Apply pirate-themed features only when whale-related content is detected:
<CodeGroup name="Basic Conditional Intervention">
```python Basic Conditional Intervention
variant.reset()
# Find relevant features
whale_feature = client.features.search(
    "whales", model=variant, top_k=1
)

pirate_features = client.features.search(
    "talk like a pirate", model=variant, top_k=5
)

# Set up conditional intervention
variant.set_when(whale_feature > 0.75, {
    pirate_features[0]: 0.4
})

# The model will now talk like a pirate when discussing whales
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about whales."}],
    model=variant
)

print(response.choices[0].message["content"])
```
```output Output text
Whales! Those majestic creatures of the sea! Did ye know that whales are actually mammals, not fish? They come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny dwarf sperm whale to the massive blue whale, which can grow up to 100 feet long!

There be different types of whales, too, like humpbacks, orcas, and belugas. Each with their own unique characteristics and behaviors. Some whales are known for their beautiful songs, while others are famous for their acrobatic tricks.

Whales are social creatures, often livin' in big groups called pods. They're also super intelligent, with some species known to use tools and communicate with each other in complex ways.

So hoist the colors, me hearty, and set course for learnin' more about these amazin' sea dwellers! What would ye like to know about whales? Their habitats? Their diets? Or maybe their conservation status? Let me know, and I'll do me best to tell ye more!
```
</CodeGroup>
### Aborting Generation

Stop generation if certain content is detected:
<CodeGroup name="Abort example">
```python Abort example
# Abort if whale features are too strong
variant.abort_when(whale_feature > 0.75)

try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about whales."}],
        model=variant
    )
except goodfire.exceptions.InferenceAbortedException:
    print("Generation aborted due to whale content")
```
```output Abort output
Generation aborted due to whale content
```
</CodeGroup>
### Auto-Generated Conditionals

Use natural language to automatically generate conditional statements:

```python Auto-Generated Conditionals example
#create a variant
variant = goodfire.Variant("meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct")
# Generate conditional based on description - this will create conditions for both whales and penguins being present
conditional= goodfire.conditional.AutoConditional(
    "when the model talks about whales and penguins",
    client=client,
    model=variant
)
# Get pirate  feature
pirate_feature = client.features.search(
    "talk like a pirate", model=variant, top_k=1
)
# Make the model talk like a pirate when it talks about both whales and penguins
variant.set_when(conditional, {
    pirate_feature[0]: 0.9
})

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about whales and penguins!"}],
    model=variant
)

print(response.choices[0].message["content"])
```

## Creating Conditionals

### Comparison Operators

You can create conditionals by comparing features or feature groups with numeric values or other features using standard comparison operators. This creates a <a href="#conditional">Conditional</a> object that can be used in steering behaviors.

```python
# Compare feature to numeric value
condition = feature > 0.75

# Compare feature group to numeric value
condition = feature_group >= 0.5

# Compare features to each other
condition = feature1 < feature2
```

Supported operators:

- `==` (equal)
- `!=` (not equal)
- `<` (less than)
- `<=` (less than or equal)
- `>` (greater than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal)

### Logical Operators

Multiple conditions can be combined using logical operators to create a <a href="#conditionalgroup">ConditionalGroup</a>:

```python
# AND operator
condition = (feature1 > 0.5) & (feature2 < 0.3)

# OR operator
condition = (feature1 > 0.5) | (feature2 > 0.5)
```

## Using Conditionals

### set_when()

Apply feature interventions when a condition is met.

**Parameters:**

<ResponseField name="condition" type="ConditionalGroup" required>
  The <a href="#conditionalgroup">ConditionalGroup</a> that triggers the
  intervention
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField
  name="values"
  type="Union[FeatureEdits, dict[Union[Feature, FeatureGroup], float]]"
  required
>
  Feature edits to apply when condition is met
</ResponseField>

**Returns:** None

**Example:**

```python
# Set pirate features when whale features are detected
variant.set_when(whale_feature > 0.75, {
    pirate_features[0]: 0.5
})
```

### abort_when()

Abort inference when a condition is met by raising an InferenceAbortedException.

**Parameters:**

<ResponseField name="condition" type="ConditionalGroup" required>
  The <a href="#conditionalgroup">ConditionalGroup</a> that triggers the abort
</ResponseField>

**Returns:** None

**Example:**

```python
# Abort if whale features are too strong
variant.abort_when(whale_feature > 0.75)

try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about whales."}],
        model=variant
    )
except goodfire.exceptions.InferenceAbortedException:
    print("Generation aborted due to whale content")
```

### handle_when()

Register a custom handler function to be called when a condition is met.

**Parameters:**

<ResponseField name="condition" type="ConditionalGroup" required>
  The <a href="#conditionalgroup">ConditionalGroup</a> that triggers the handler
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField
  name="handler"
  type="Callable[[InferenceContext], None]"
  required
>
  Function that takes an <a href="#inferencecontext">InferenceContext</a> and
  returns None
</ResponseField>

**Returns:** None

**Example:**

```python
def custom_handler(context: InferenceContext):
    # Custom handling logic
    pass

variant.handle_when(whale_feature > 0.5, custom_handler)
```

## AutoConditional

The AutoConditional utility helps automatically generate conditional statements based on natural language descriptions.

**Parameters:**

<ResponseField name="specification" type="str" required>
  Natural language description of the desired condition
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="client" type="Client" required>
  Goodfire client instance
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="model" type="Union[str, Variant]" required>
  Model to use for generating conditions
</ResponseField>

**Returns:**

<ResponseField name="conditional" type="ConditionalGroup">
  Generated <a href="#conditionalgroup">ConditionalGroup</a>
</ResponseField>

**Example:**

```python
# Generate conditional based on description - this will create conditions for both whales and penguins being present
conditional= goodfire.conditional.AutoConditional(
    "when the model talks about whales and penguins",
    client=client,
    model=variant
)
# Get pirate  feature
pirate_feature = client.features.search(
    "talk like a pirate", model=variant, top_k=1
)
# Make the model talk like a pirate when it talks about both whales and penguins
variant.set_when(conditional, {
    pirate_feature[0]: 0.9
})
```

## Best Practices

- Use conditional interventions to create context-aware steering behaviors
- Combine multiple conditions with logical operators for more precise control
- Handle aborted inferences gracefully in your application
- Test conditions thoroughly to ensure desired behavior
- Consider using AutoConditional for quick prototyping
