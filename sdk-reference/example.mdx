## Client

The Goodfire SDK provides both synchronous and asynchronous clients for interacting with the Goodfire API. The main client classes are organized into three main interfaces:

- [Features API](/sdk-reference/features) - For working with interpretable features
- [Chat API](/sdk-reference/chat) - For interacting with language models
- [Variants API](/sdk-reference/variants) - For managing model variants

### Initialization

<CodeGroup>
```python Async
from goodfire import AsyncClient

client = AsyncClient("your-api-key")

````

```python Sync
from goodfire import Client

client = Client("your-api-key")
````

</CodeGroup>
