## Client

The Goodfire SDK provides both synchronous and asynchronous clients for interacting with the Goodfire API.

The examples provided in this guide are for the synchronous client. The asynchronous client is identical but with `await` added to the function calls.

We've broken down the SDK into a few key concepts:

- [Chat Completions](/sdk-reference/chat) - For interacting with language models
- [Variants](/sdk-reference/variants) - For managing model edits & variants
- [Features](/sdk-reference/features) - For working with interpretable features
- [Conditionals](/sdk-reference/conditionals) - For working with conditional feature interventions
- [AutoSteering](/sdk-reference/autosteer) - For steering models with natural language

### Initialization

<CodeGroup>
```python Sync
from goodfire import Client

client = Client("your-api-key")

````

```python Async
from goodfire import AsyncClient

client = AsyncClient("your-api-key")

````

</CodeGroup>
